# NxtTrendz - The E-commerce Website

Welcome to NxtTrendz, a modern and feature-rich e-commerce platform built with React JS. This application provides a seamless shopping experience for both prime and non-prime users, featuring a wide range of products, advanced filtering options, and a robust cart system.

## ‚ú® Features

### User Authentication & Authorization

  - **Secure Logins:** Users can securely log in using a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system.
  - **Role-Based Access:** The application distinguishes between "Prime" and "Non-Prime" users, potentially offering different features or privileges (e.g., special discounts, free shipping) based on their user status.
  - **Login/Signup:** A dedicated login and registration page allows new users to create an account and existing users to sign in.

### Product Management

  - **Extensive Product Catalog:** Browse a diverse collection of products across various categories.
  - **Advanced Filtering:** Easily find what you're looking for with multiple filtering options:
      - **Category Filters:** Filter products by specific categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.).
      - **Rating Filters:** Filter products based on user ratings.
  - **Product Sorting:** Sort the product list to prioritize your search:
      - **Price-Based Sorting:** Arrange products by price in ascending (Low to High) or descending (High to Low) order.

### Detailed Product Views

  - **Product Description Page:** Click on any product to view a detailed page containing:
      - High-resolution images.
      - Comprehensive product descriptions.
      - Pricing information.
      - User ratings and reviews.
  - **Recommended Products:** On the product description page, a "Recommended Products" section suggests similar items, enhancing the user's browsing experience.

### Shopping Cart

  - **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart from both the product listing and the detailed product page.
  - **Cart Management:** The cart feature allows users to:
      - View all selected items.
      - Adjust the quantity of each item.
      - Remove items from the cart.
  - **Persistent Cart:** The cart's state is maintained across different sessions (if the user is logged in), so they won't lose their selected items.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

  - **Frontend:**
      - **React JS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Backend:**
      - **REST API:** Handles all server-side logic, including user authentication, product data fetching, and cart management.
  - **Templating:**
      - **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating):** Used for server-side rendering, especially for initial page loads or dynamic content generation.
  - **Authentication:**
      - **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used for secure user authentication and authorization.
